<p>I am a self-taught JavaScript developer based off Calgary Alberta, studying mathematics and biology off of free online resource websites like
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/solarc117"
    >Khan Academy</a
  >
  and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/solarc">freeCodeCamp</a
  >, among a few others.
</p>
<ul>
  Experience with:
  <li>Node and Express</li>
  <li>React/Redux</li>
  <li>MDB and MQL (Mongo Querying Language)</li>
  <li>
    D3 (Data-Driven Documents, a JavaScript library for data visualization)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I also enjoy reading non-fiction and listening to podcasts about health, ghost
  stories and philosophy.

<p>
  I hope to get a developer job so I can help out my family in Mexico, take
  friends out more often, and hopefully do some good out there ðŸ™‚
