title: About
---

<p>I am a (currently) self-taught programmer based off Calgary Alberta.</p>
<p>
  I'm studying mathematics and biology off of free online resource websites like
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/solarc117"
    >Khan Academy</a
  >
  and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/solarc">freeCodeCamp</a
  >, among a few others.
</p>
<p>
  I also enjoy reading non-fiction and listening to podcasts about health, ghost
  stories and philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  I hope to get a developer job so I can help out my family in Mexico, take
  friends out more often, and hopefully do some good out there ðŸ™‚
